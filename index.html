         <p>One of the most efficient and deadly drones popularly known as Predator was manufactured by the General Atomics Aeronautical Systems Corporation based in the United States. The Predator is a provision fighter designed with the performance that allows it to last longer and achieve higher altitudes when surveillance than its then competitors in the market.

            The first prototype was made in 2001 when the first flight was made. The predator was primarily designed for reconnaissance and surveillance, greatly aided by the highly developed technology of various sensors implemented inside the aircraft, such as a thermographic camera for night-vision.

         <p>The X-47B UCAS-D is currently one of the most modern and technologically advanced combat drones in the world of military drone technology. It was subjected to various tests before being put into operation in 2019. The X-47B is a drone with an autonomous control function without a repatriate, powered by a jet engine that provides it with top performance.

            The first successful test flight took place in February 2011 at Edwards Air Force Base in California, USA. The X-47B technology development program initially cost $636 million, but due to additional demonstrations, the program’s budget increased to approximately $813 million.
            
            The X-47B is a demonstration model of the drone that the US military plans to upgrade to the factory model X-47C, which will go into series production. The Americans continue the tradition of dominating the development and production of high-tech drones whose primary purpose is the military. The best example of this is the X-47B.</p>

                           The UAV is launched from a trailer-mounted catapult and requires arresting gear on an aircraft to recover the device.
                           
                           Army troops have sought an effective battlefield drone since the cancellation of the Alliant RQ-6 Outrider.
                           
                           The impressive range of the smaller drone helps support Army operations though it is restricted in bad weather conditions.</p>

                           The Navy version is known as the X-47B while the original drone is called the X-47A Pegasus.
                           
                           The U.S. Navy is among the last branches to get on board with incorporating military drones into operations.
                           
                           Northrop Grumman X-47 is a demonstrater drone after a successful first launch in the early-2000s.</p>

                        <h3>MQ-9 Reaper</h3>
                        <p>General Atomics MQ-9 Reaper (also called Predator B) is one of the most popular military drones.

                           The United States Air Force primarily uses the MQ-9 Reaper though it is also used by the Navy, CIA, and NASA.
                           
                           It is considered the first “hunter-killer UAV” with a design that promotes high altitude and long endurance missions.
                           
                           The MQ-9 Reaper made headlines in 2008 when it was announced the Air National Guard in New York was beginning a transition from converting F-16 pilot fighters to Mq-9A operators.
                           
                           There are plans to keep the MQ-9 Reaper in service until the 2030s due to its outstanding and dependable operation.</p>

                        <p>General Atomics has another offering with the MQ-1 Predator which is primarily used by the Air Force and CIA.

                           The MQ-1 Predator is one of the original military drones with an initial conception in the early 1990s.
                           
                           The military set out to produce an aerial reconnaissance UAV with high powered cameras and other sensors.
                           
                           A final design is so effective that the MQ-1 Predator has seen combat in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq, Serbia, Yemen, Syria, and Somalia.
                           
                           The drone is considered a “Tier II” MALE UAS which means it provides medium-altitude, long-endurance capabilities.</p>

                        <p>The Northrop Grumman MQ-8 Fire Scout is for reconnaissance, aerial fire support, precision targeting support, and situational awareness.

                           The U.S. Navy embraced the design of the MQ-8 Fire Scout after initially not being blown away by early versions.
                           
                           It features a four-blade main rotor different from the RQ-8A UAV.
                           
                           The design reduces noise and improves lift capacity for reconnaissance work.</p>

                  <p>The Northrop Grumman RQ-4 Global Hawk is a high-altitude, remotely-piloted surveillance aircraft of the 1990s–2020s. It was initially designed by Ryan Aeronautical (now part of Northrop Grumman), 
                     and known as Tier II+ during development. The RQ-4 provides a broad overview and systematic surveillance using high-resolution synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and electro-optical/infrared (EO/IR) sensors with long loiter times over target areas.</p>

                  <p>The IAI Heron (Machatz-1) is a medium-altitude long-endurance unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) developed by the Malat (UAV) division of Israel Aerospace Industries. It is capable of Medium Altitude Long Endurance (MALE) operations of up to 52 hours' duration at up to 10.5 km (35,000 ft). It has demonstrated 52 hours of continuous flight, but the effective operational maximal flight duration is less, according to payload and flight profile. An advanced version, the Heron TP, is also known as the IAI Eitan.</p>

Developed by the American defense technology company Northrop Grumman, the X-47 project began as part of DARPA's J-UCAS program, and subsequently became part of the United States Navy's Unmanned Combat Air System Demonstration (UCAS-D) program. The X-47B is a tailless jet-powered blended-wing-body aircraft capable of semi-autonomous operation and aerial refueling.[1]
